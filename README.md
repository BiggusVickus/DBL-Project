# DBL-Project
 
To get the local server to work, you need to go to the terminal window. 
First activate the virtual environment by typing ```. venv/bin/activate```. 
Then you have to do ```pip install flask```
Then to run the server, type ```python main.py```. Some stuff appears in the terminal window. click on ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` (or just copy paste this) and it will open up a new window on chrome or whatever. You can upload a jpeg, pdf, csv, png file. The file will then be pushed to the "Uploads" folder. I also added a functionality that we cn go to different pages for different visualizations. 
Please create a new branch from main so that any changes made are not reflected upon the whole branch. Then work in that branch, and when you are ready to push a stable change, like adding a functionality that works, then you may push to master. I (Victor) will review it and accept it.
