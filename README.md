To get the local server to work, you need to go to the terminal window. 
First activate the virtual environment by typing ```. venv/bin/activate```. 
Then you have to do ```pip install flask```
Then to run the server, type ```python main.py```. Some stuff appears in the terminal window. click on ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/``` and it will open up a new window on chrome or whatever. You can upload a jpeg, pdf, csv, png file. The file will then be pushed to the "Uploads" folder.
